## Getting Started

1. **New Developers**: Start with [Development Workflows](./development-workflows.md) for setup and conventions
2. **UI Development**: Reference [Design System](./design-system.md) for component usage
3. **Simulation Work**: Study [Simulation Architecture](./simulation-architecture.md) for widget patterns
4. **Content Management**: Use [Sanity CMS Documentation](./sanity-cms-documentation.md) for CMS integration
5. **API Integration**: Follow [API Integration Guide](./api-integration-guide.md) for external services

## Contributing to Documentation

When making significant changes to the codebase:

1. **Update Relevant Documentation**: Keep docs in sync with code changes
2. **Add New Patterns**: Document new architectural patterns for future reference
3. **Include Examples**: Provide practical examples for complex concepts
4. **Cross-reference**: Link related concepts across documents

## Documentation Standards

- **Code Examples**: Include complete, working code snippets
- **File Locations**: Always specify file paths for referenced code
- **TypeScript**: Use proper TypeScript interfaces in examples
- **Best Practices**: Explain not just how, but why patterns are recommended
- **Future Considerations**: Note planned enhancements and migrations

These documentation files serve as the single source of truth for ExaWatt development practices and should be consulted before implementing new features or making architectural decisions.
